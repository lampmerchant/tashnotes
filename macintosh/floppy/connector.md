### 19-Pin D-Subminiature Connector

The non-standard 19-pin D-subminiature connector used for external drive connectors is frequently referred to as a "DB-19", but this is incorrect as "DB" refers to a larger D-subminiature shell size which holds 25, 44, or 52 (typically 25) pins.

## Pin Assignments (Common)

\* The last ground (D-subminiature pin 4) is left floating by drives compatible with Apple II computers.

## Pin Assignments (Per Macintosh Model)

### §

| Macintosh Model         | Pin Name/Function | Source       | Direction |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 128K, 512K, 512Ke, Plus | -12V              | Power Supply | ->        |
| SE*, IIcx*, IIci*       | -12V              | Power Supply | ->        |
| Other†                  | Not Connected     | --           | --        |

\* D-subminiature connector only; on 2x10 pin header, this pin is not connected.

Direction is Macintosh relative to drive.

† Macintosh models with manual-inject floppy drives may connect this pin to ground, which may cause automatic-inject floppy drives to eject constantly.
